# gdrive-upload-action
### Github action that uploads files to Google Drive.

**Only works with a Google Service Account!**

To make a Google Service Account, go to the [Credentials Dashboard](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials) and press `CREATE CREDENTIALS`, then click on `Service Account`. After creating the SA, go back to the Credentials Dashboard, click on the SA you just created, click on the `KEYS` tabs. Then click on `ADD KEY`, `Create New Key` and select `json`.

### Encoded credentials
1. Encode the credentials.

    `cat credentials.json | base64`

2. Create a new Github secret called `credentials` and copy the output of the previous command into this secret.

3. Use this secret as your credentials input in your workflow.

### Plaintext credentials

1. Create a new Github secret called `credentials` paste the contents of the credentials file you just downloaded in it.

2. Use this secret as your credentials input in your workflow.

3. Set the `encoded` input to `false` in your workflow.


You will also need to **share the drive with the service account.** To do this, just share the folder like you would normally with a friend, except you share it with the service account email address. Go to `https://console.developers.google.com/apis/api/drive.googleapis.com/overview?project={PROJECT_ID}`. Where `{PROJECT_ID}` is the id of your GCP project. 

Find more info about your Drives project ID [here.](https://support.google.com/googleapi/answer/7014113?hl=en)


Additionally you need to enable the Google Drive API for your GCP project. Do this by going [here](https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace/product/google/drive.googleapis.com) and pressing `ENABLE`.

# Usage Example

## Simple Workflow
In this example we stored the folderId and credentials as action secrets. This is highly recommended as leaking your credentials key will allow anyone to use your service account.
```yaml
# .github/workflows/main.yml
name: Main
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - 'master'
      - 'main'
      - '!test'

jobs:
  gdrive-upload:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Archive files
        run: |
          sudo apt-get update
          sudo apt-get install zip
          zip -r archive.zip *

      - name: Upload to gdrive
        uses: mathisve/gdrive-upload-action@main
        with:
          filename: archive.zip
          name: documentation.zip
          folderId: ${{ secrets.folderId }}
          credentials: ${{ secrets.credentials }}
          encoded: false
```

# Inputs

## ``filename``

## ``credentials``

A string with the [GSA credentials](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46287267/how-can-i-get-the-file-service-account-json-for-google-translate-api/46290808).
This string should be base64 encoded. If it is not, set the `encoded` input to `false`.

## ``encoded``
Required: **NO**

Whether or not the credentials string is base64 encoded. Defaults to `true`.
